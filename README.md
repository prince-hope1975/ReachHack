## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Having a fair implementation of Battleship on the blockchain is fairly difficult, and that's exactly what is implemented on this repo using reach.

<!-- - IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or “to be” state of the process or product. At large, this section
  should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or “as is” state of the process or product.
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
  This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth. -->

<!-- Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution. -->

<!-- ## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem. -->

<!-- ## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- React
- Reach
- Reach stdlib
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research. -->

<!-- ## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future. -->

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

To get this project running on your local environment for development `docker` and `docker compose ` are needed

<!-- ### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```
